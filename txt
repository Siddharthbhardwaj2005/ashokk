Mr. Asoke K. Ghosh, The Father of Indian Publishing
(31st October 1942- 1st February 2024)


In the illustrious realm of international publishing, the name of Asoke K. Ghosh continues to resonate with reverence and admiration. As the Chairman and Managing Director of PHI Learning Private Limited, Delhi, Ghosh not only carved a niche for himself but also left an indelible mark on the global publishing landscape. His journey, spanning over six decades, was a testament to his unwavering dedication, innovative spirit, and profound impact on the world of education and literature.

Often hailed as the “Father of Indian Publishing” on the international stage, Ghosh's visionary endeavours in the 1960s revolutionized the accessibility of higher education publications, with the introduction of Eastern Economy Editions (EEE). These affordable yet high-quality books filled a critical void in the academic sphere, empowering Indian scholars with access to world-class resources at a fraction of the cost.

Ghosh's foresight was equally evident in embracing technological advancements. In 1969, he became the trailblazer in Indian publishing by releasing the first-ever book on Computer Science, anticipating the burgeoning importance of this field. Decades later, in 2007, he once again led the industry into the digital age by pioneering the release of Digital Editions, laying the groundwork for the future of publishing in India.

Ghosh's remarkable achievements garnered him numerous national and international accolades, including the prestigious 'Simon Master Chairman’s Award' and the inaugural 'IPA Champion Award' from the International Publishing Association (IPA). Also, his visionary initiatives earned him admiration from Government of India and publishers nationwide. The Federation of Indian Publishers (FIP) honoured him with numerous accolades, including ‘Lifetime Achievement Award’, and recently, in 2023, he was honoured with the title ‘Dhruv Tara’ (The Pole Star), recognising his outstanding contribution to publishing, presented by the Director of National Book Trust (NBT), during the New Delhi World Book Fair 2023. These honours underscored his exceptional contributions to the field and recognised him as a luminary in the realm of publishing.

Beyond his professional achievements, Ghosh's humanitarian efforts reflected his deep compassion and commitment to giving back to society. In memory of his daughter, he founded the Rimjhim Ghosh Foundation, offering free education and healthcare to underprivileged girls.

As a Rotarian for over four decades, Ghosh’s commitment to community welfare earned him the highest accolades from Rotary International — ‘Distinguished Service Award’, ‘Service Above Self Award’, and the Citation for ‘Meritorious Service Award’— further securing his legacy as a humanitarian leader. 

In every facet of his life, Asoke K. Ghosh exemplified excellence, compassion, and vision. His extraordinary life and countless achievements remind us that true greatness lies not only in personal success but in the positive impact we leave on the world. 

We honour his initiative and dedication in empowering society with timely access to high quality textbooks!
