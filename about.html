                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                        In the illustrious realm of international publishing, the name of Asoke K. Ghosh continues to resonate with reverence and admiration. As the Chairman and Managing Director of PHI Learning Private Limited, Delhi, Ghosh not only carved a niche for himself but also left an indelible mark on the global publishing landscape. His journey, spanning over six decades, was a testament to his unwavering dedication, innovative spirit, and profound impact on the world of education and literature.

                    <p class="leading-relaxed text-slate-700">
                        Often hailed as the “Father of Indian Publishing” on the international stage, Ghosh's visionary endeavours in the 1960s revolutionized the accessibility of higher education publications, with the introduction of Eastern Economy Editions (EEE). These affordable yet high-quality books filled a critical void in the academic sphere, empowering Indian scholars with access to world-class resources at a fraction of the cost.

                        Ghosh's foresight was equally evident in embracing technological advancements. In 1969, he became the trailblazer in Indian publishing by releasing the first-ever book on Computer Science, anticipating the burgeoning importance of this field. Decades later, in 2007, he once again led the industry into the digital age by pioneering the release of Digital Editions, laying the groundwork for the future of publishing in India.

                        Ghosh's remarkable achievements garnered him numerous national and international accolades, including the prestigious 'Simon Master Chairman’s Award' and the inaugural 'IPA Champion Award' from the International Publishing Association (IPA). Also, his visionary initiatives earned him admiration from Government of India and publishers nationwide. The Federation of Indian Publishers (FIP) honoured him with numerous accolades, including ‘Lifetime Achievement Award’, and recently, in 2023, he was honoured with the title ‘Dhruv Tara’ (The Pole Star), recognising his outstanding contribution to publishing, presented by the Director of National Book Trust (NBT), during the New Delhi World Book Fair 2023. These honours underscored his exceptional contributions to the field and recognised him as a luminary in the realm of publishing.
