            <h2>Mr. Asoke K. Ghosh, The Father of Indian Publishing (31st October 1942 - 1st February 2024)</h2>
            <p>In the illustrious realm of international publishing, the name of Asoke K. Ghosh continues to resonate with reverence and admiration.

In 1969, he became the trailblazer in Indian publishing by releasing the first-ever book on Computer Science, anticipating the burgeoning importance of this field. Decades later, in 2007, he once again led the industry into the digital age by pioneering the release of Digital Editions, laying the groundwork for the future of publishing in India.</p>
